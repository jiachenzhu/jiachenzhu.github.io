### About Me (Jiachen Zhu / 朱家晨）
I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at NYU Courant, advised by [Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/). \
I am also a Visiting Researcher at FAIR, Meta, where I am hosted by [Zhuang Liu](https://liuzhuang13.github.io/) and [Koustuv Sinha](https://koustuvsinha.com/).

### Education
- PhD, Computer Science, [New York University](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html), 2020 - Now
- MSc, Computer Science, [New York University](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html), 2018 - 2020
- BSc, Computer Science, [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/), 2010 - 2015

### Research Interests
My research focuses on self-supervised learning for images and videos, as well as pretraining vision encoders for vision-language models (VLMs). I am also interested in understanding the design of all kind of neural network architectures.
